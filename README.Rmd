Read Me for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
========================================================

In order to use "run_analysis.R" you will need to first download and unzip the data into your working directory. The data is avaialbale at:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Doing this will create a folder in your working directory named "UCI HAR Dataset" which contains all of the necessary files.

run_analysis.R Description

The "run_analysis.R" file accomplishes the objectives of the "Project Assignment" (see section below for details) as follows:

1. Data from "features.txt" file is read (using read.table) to be used as the column labels for the test and training data. A single vector "activityDF" is created
2. Data from "activity_labels.txt" file is read to be used as a key to provide a description of each numerically coded activity
3. Measurement data from "X_test.txt" is read into a table
4. Data from "subject_test.txt" is read. This file has an subject identifier for each row of measurement data in "X_Test.txt"
5. Data from "y_test.txt" is read. This file has a numerical activity identifier for each row of measurement data in "X_Test.txt"
6. Columns labels from "activityDF" are added to measurement data using colnames()
7. Activity key data is indexed to activity description and added as column to measurement data
8. Column label "subject" add to subject key data using colnames()
9. Measurement data and subject data merged using cbind()
10. Steps 3 through 9 repeated for training data
11. Test and training data are merged using rbind()
12. Column labels are cleansed (required for select() and contains() to function properly)
13. Create new data set from columns subject, activity, and any measurement data column label that contained either "mean" or "std" using select() and contains()
14. Create final data set using pipeline operator (%>%) to group by subject and activity and calculate the average of each measurement variable using summarise_each()
15. Save file "tidyData.txt" to working directory. Note: see CodeBook.txt for description of file contents

Project Assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The R script "run_analysis.R" accomplishes the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
